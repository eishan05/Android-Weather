# Task
Create an app that has one button. When the button is pressed, the current temperature in Houston Texas is shown in a text field. By current temperature, we mean the temperature when we run your app.

# Your comments or assumptions
- For this project, I used Open Weather Map API. The API gives me a link which I can use to send an http request and get back a JSON object as a response. I used Android's in-built JSON parsing library to extract information from the JSON object. Currently, the code is not working as intended but I can make it work given enough time. As I need to submit my application to UBC Launchpad before Sept 8, I am submitting this code for now.
